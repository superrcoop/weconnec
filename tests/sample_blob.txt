Weconnec intends to resolve the need for a central platform that allows, primarily students to share resources among themselves. Often times barriers impede how effective study resources are shared among students. One such barrier is association. Students may not know the right persons to be affiliated with in order to get helpful resources. In addition, the project also seeks to enhance how efficient students can manipulate study resources. "WeConnec" is a web-based platform that grants users access to a library of documents as well as allow them to share documents with persons from their friend list after signing up for an account. Users have the option of making uploaded resources public or private. The platform's main function is to allow users to search through a large pool of documents return relevant information based on the query in a timely manner. Another function that the project will implement is an answer search engine, this will allow users to pose a question after which a response, formulated from uploaded documents, will be returned. This response should have the correct answer for the question or if the engine could not find an appropriate answer it should suggest some resources that might contain the desired answer.
